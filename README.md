# BUPT Campus Food Photo Archive

This repository contains an organized collection of food photos from various campus dining locations. Each photo captures a specific dish, providing a visual guide for students, staff, and visitors to explore and discover the diverse food options available on campus. The photos are sorted into folders based on the location of the dining facility and further categorized into sub-folders for each individual dish.

The Campus Food Photo Archive aims to:

* Offer a comprehensive visual directory of food options available across campus dining facilities.
* Help users make informed dining choices based on their preferences and dietary needs.
* Showcase the variety and quality of food offered on campus.
* Provide a useful resource for new students, staff, and visitors to familiarize themselves with campus dining options.
* Encourage the campus community to share their own food photos and experiences, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.
